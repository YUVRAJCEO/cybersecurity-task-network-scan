Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation

Objective
Understand what makes a password strong by testing multiple passwords of varying complexity and analyzing their strength using online password strength tools.



Tools Used
- [Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com/)
- [NordPass Strength Checker](https://nordpass.com/password-strength-checker/)
- [Kaspersky Password Check](https://password.kaspersky.com/)


Methodology
1. **Created multiple passwords** â€” short, medium, and long â€” with different mixes of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols.  
2. **Tested each password** using the above strength checkers.  
3. **Recorded scores and feedback** for each password.  
4. **Compared strength levels** and identified patterns affecting password quality.  
5. **Summarized best practices** based on results.

 Sample Passwords and Results

| Password | Complexity | Strength Score | Feedback |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| `pass123` | Weak | 20% | Too short, lacks symbols and uppercase letters. |
| `P@ssw0rd!` | Medium | 60% | Common pattern, add length and randomness. |
| `Cyb3r$afe@2025!` | Strong | 95% | Great length, mix of characters, hard to guess. |
| `YvR@!92x#ZkLp$21` | Very Strong | 100% | Excellent entropy and randomness. |

 Key Learnings
- Longer passwords exponentially increase security against brute-force attacks.  
- Use a mix of **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.  
- Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns.  
- Password managers can generate and store complex passwords securely.  
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) further enhances protection.

 Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack:** Trying every possible combination until success.  
- **Dictionary Attack:** Using precompiled lists of common passwords or words.  
- **Phishing:** Tricking users into revealing their credentials.  


 Best Practices for Password Creation
- Minimum **12â€“16 characters** long.  
- Use **random words, numbers, and special symbols**.  
- Avoid personal details (name, DOB, phone).  
- Update passwords regularly.  
- Use a **password manager** for complex credentials.
